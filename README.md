# Incremental Delta Bar Delta (IDBD)
IDBD is an algorithm for meta-learning step-sizes.
It was introduced by Rich Sutton in the following paper:

>Sutton, R.S. (1992). [Adapting bias by gradient descent: An incremental version of delta-bar-delta](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/papers/sutton-92a.pdf). 
_Proceedings of the Tenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence_, pp. 171-176, MIT Press.

The code replicates an experiment from this paper.
